# FSRTracker - Five Second Rule Tracker for Project-Epoch 3.3.5

Download the .rar in the release and unzip it to your addons folder, or add the two files above to a folder named FSRTracker in your addons...

The first tick will always be an estimated 0.1-2 seconds after the 5 second blue bar fills

All the ticks after that should be 100% on time with your mana regen since it uses the first mana regen tick as the base for the timer...

Enjoy finally drink walking without having to guess mana ticks! I've been looking for an addon or weakaura that does this for 3.3.5 for a long ass time...

Commands:

/fsr scale (sets the scale of the bar, accepted values are between 0.5 and 3)

/fsr unlock (unlocks the bar)

/fsr lock (locks the bar)

/fsr center (centers the bar horizontally)

/fsr reset (resets the bar completely back to factory settings xd)
